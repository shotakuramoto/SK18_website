								<p>I was born in Osaka, Japan. Spent my first four years of life in Japan and then immigrated to Adealide, Australia. I went to local kindergarden and primary school. After four years of life in Adealide, my family moved to Brisbane. Spent 9 months in Brisbane and moved back to Japan when I was year 3. Coming back to Japan and studying at local school was a massive challenge and suffered from langauge. I graduated local juniour high school there and finished composluary education. Then, I decided to move back to Australia to learn English and to take education with a lot of freedom. Graduated Marryatville High school with 3 merit/excellence awards and enrolled into the University of Adelaide. </p>
								<p>Currently, I am studying business and computer science, and I am considering to take corporate finance and artificial intelligence as major of two of them. I believe artificial intelligence will be one of the biggest field of computer science industry. However, understanding the numbers will be always important even AI is smarter and faster to solve it. Therefore I am looking for a future job that I can use both my computer science and busienss knowledge such as IT consultant. </p>
								<p>After my university graduation, I am thining to find a job in Tokyo or new country. I think I can maximise advatange in Tokyo. However, I am also thinking to move to different country such as Singpaore. When I went to Singapore in September 2019, I saw a great financial and advanced city that can match Tokyo for the first time. I am searching for an exchange program to Singapore National University for my future.</p>
